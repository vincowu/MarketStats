# MarketStats
*MarketStats is a financial stock tracking application that I created to emulate some features that can be found on common financial data sites like yahooFinance or marketwatch. I really enjoy analyzing stocks and learning more about different companies that are listed which is why I decided to try and create a project like this!*

## Tech Stack Used:
*React, Node, Express, SCSS/SASS, APIS(Marketstack and Alphavantage), Chartjs, MongoDB, Mongoose* 

## How to install:
1. *Fork the repo and clone it onto your local device*
2. *cd into market-stats-vinco-wu and run npm install in both server and client folders*
3. *In the server folder, rename .env.sample to .env and follow the instructions within, you would need to create an account for both Alphavantage and Marketstack which both have free plans*
4. *After creating an account for both Alphavantage and MarketStack*


## Features and User Interface for this project includes:
1. *Search your favorite companies by stock ticker symbol *
Will return a chart of past performance of stock as well as various information about the company such as PE ratio, Outstanding Shares, Market Cap, etc.*
2. *Can log in to an account specific to users and create a watchlist tracking their favorite stocks*
Once you log in and add stocks to your watchlist, they will appear in the watchlist table and your weekly and daily percentage gains will also appear under the returns section.*
